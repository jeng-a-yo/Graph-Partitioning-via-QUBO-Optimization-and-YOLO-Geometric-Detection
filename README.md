# QUBO Graph Partitioning with YOLO Integration

## Overview

This project integrates the QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) formulation with the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm to tackle the graph partitioning problem. The aim is to automate the process of analyzing images depicting connected graphs, extracting accurate adjacency matrices using YOLO, and utilizing QUBO solutions to determine the optimal partitioning strategy.

## Introduction

Graph partitioning is pivotal across various domains, including parallel computing and network design. This project leverages QUBO to optimize partitioning and enhances it by integrating YOLO for robust object detection in graph images. The approach not only automates adjacency matrix generation but also optimizes partitioning strategies based on graph complexity and connectivity.

## Features

- **Automated Graph Analysis**: Generate and analyze connected graph images automatically.
- **Object Detection with YOLO**: Utilize YOLO for accurate node and edge detection in graph images.
- **Optimized Partitioning**: Apply QUBO formulations to optimize graph partitioning strategies.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Configurable parameters for varying graph complexities and optimization requirements.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- `numpy`, `Pillow`, `yolov5`, `pyqubo`, `networkx`
- GPU support for efficient YOLO inference

## Integration Details

### YOLO Integration

1. **Model Training**: Train the YOLO model on a dataset of graph images to detect nodes and edges.
2. **Detection**: Use the trained YOLO model to detect graph components in new images.
